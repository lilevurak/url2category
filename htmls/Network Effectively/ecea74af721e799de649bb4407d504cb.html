              <p class="MsoNormal">Critically examine the past efforts and discuss the emergence of new trends in community organization. </p> 
              <p class="MsoNormal">2.2INTRODUCTION:</p> 
              <p class="MsoNormal">The previous chapters have given you a birds eye view on the concept of community organization and its various principles. As you are already aware that, It has been practiced as a method of social work in the western countries; especially in England and USA. However, Little has been written about the history of community organization. Community organization is a process and is all about solving the present day today problems of common interests by way of adopting democratic principles and peoples participation. People have used this method in the past and have attained desired results. Thus, it is important for the students of community organization to understand the past, draw lessons from it and develop and experiment new models and methods required to work with community.</p> 
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style=""> </span></p> 
              <p class="MsoNormal">In this chapter, we will be dealing with the History of community organization in England, USA and provide you with a brief idea about the community organization practice in India. In the later part of the chapter, we will also discuss some of the models and approaches of community organization..</p> 
              <p class="MsoNormal">WHY SHOULD WE STUDY HISTORY? </p> 
              <p class="MsoNormal">We can learn a lot from the history, that variety of social- change groups faced with long odds and with slim beginnings won out in the end. History makes us clear that slow times need not mean the death of hope. But lends us patience while teaching us persistence. The strategies adopted in the past provide us concrete lessons on tactics and approaches allowing each generation to build on the knowledge of its predecessors. It is all about the problems the people experienced and the solution they achieved.<span style=""> </span></p> 
              <p class="MsoNormal">In short, history sensitizes us to the problems and possibilities of change, provides concrete advice for the present-day action, and sustain our action with the hope and pride that comes from learning of past experience. Therefore, the study of the History of community organization becomes essential for a social worker.</p> 
              <p class="MsoNormal">COMMUNITY ORGANIZATION:</p> 
              <p class="MsoNormal">The term "community organization covers a series of activities at the community level aimed at bringing about desired improvement in the social well being of individuals, groups and neighborhoods". Community organizing is about creating a </p> 
              <p class="MsoNormal">Democratic instrument to bring about sustained social change. According to Murray G.Ross, " Community organization is a process by which a community identifies needs and takes action, and in doing so... develops co-operative attitudes and practices."</p> 
              <p class="MsoNormal">2.3. PHILOSOPHY OF COMMUNITY ORGANIZATION:</p> 
              <p class="MsoNormal">The early attempts in community organization were an outcome of the serious problems i.e. problems of unemployment, poverty etc. faced by the communities. Thus grew up many organisations and social agencies to provide support to the community. Soon, it was realized that all these efforts need to be co-ordinated and streamlined so as to avoid duplicity of work and to reduce the gap in the delivery of services to the community.<span style=""> </span>At one point of time we might ask, What has been the driving force behind all these efforts that prompted the people of Good will to render services to the community?<span style=""> </span>Let us look at the Philosophy of Community Organization, which may throw some light on this theme.</p> 
              <p class="MsoNormal">The fundamental aspect of the community organizations is the principle of " Co-operative spirit" which promotes the people to unite together to address a common issue.</p> 
              <p class="MsoNormal">Community organization recognizes the spirit of democratic values and principles and community organization is about is creating democratic involvement.</p> 
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style=""> </span></p> 
              <p class="MsoNormal">Organizing is about empowering. When people unite together, barring all discriminations and get involved in the community organizations, they develop confidence. This empowerment comes when people learn skills to help themselves and others. The collective action helps in community building.</p> 
              <p class="MsoNormal">The community organization recognizes the power of individual. It believes, through the collective strength of the people, better teamwork and adopting scientific methods can make comprehensive social problems.</p> 
              <p class="MsoNormal">Another Philosophy is that of coordination. It is concerned with the adjustments and inter-relations of the forces in the community life for a common welfare. </p> 
              <p class="MsoNormal">Community organization is therefore, is a continuous process in which adjustments are made and remade to keep pace with the changing conditions of community life. </p> 
              <p class="MsoNormal">2.4. HISTORY OF COMMUNITY ORGANIZATION:</p> 
              <p class="MsoNormal">In a broad sense we can say wherever people have lived together, some form of organisations has emerged. These informal associations of people always tried to do good to the people in need and protect the rights of the society. On the contrary the history talks about the formal organizations which were set up for the welfare of the community. The first efforts at community organization for social welfare were initiated in England to overcome the acute problem of poverty, which led to beggary.</p> 
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style=""> </span></p> 
              <p class="MsoNormal">The first effort of its kind was the Elizabethan poor law (1601) in England, which was set up to provide services to the needy. Another important landmark in the history of community organization is the formation of London Society of organizing charitable relief and repressing mendicancy and the Origin of the settlement house Movement in England during 1880.</p> 
              <p class="MsoNormal">In fact, these movements had a major impact in the United States of America. In 1880 the Charities organization was set up to put rational order in the area of charity and relief. The major community organization activities in the United States could be classified in to three periods:</p> 
              <p class="MsoNormal">The Charity organization period. 1870-1917:</p> 
              <p class="MsoNormal">This era is the beginnings in social welfare in USA. The first citywide (COS) Charity organization Society was established in the Buffalo in 1877 in USA. This movement was started with the influence of London Charity organization established in 1869. In USA, Rev.S.H.Gurteen, an English priest who had an association with London Charity association and had moved to Baffalo in 1873 gave the leadership to this movement an English priest who had an association with London Charity association and had moved to Baffalo in 1873. With in a short span of six years the COS had reached to more than 25 American cities.</p> 
              <p class="MsoNormal">Charity organization was concerned about two things:</p> 
              <p class="MsoNormal">Providing adequate personal services to families and individuals in need</p> 
              <p class="MsoNormal">Take steps to address the issues/problems in social welfare.</p> 
              <p class="MsoNormal">Apart from this services the COS also took initiatives in promoting co-operation among the various welfare agencies. From this movement of charity organization emerged many other such service oriented organisations i.e. Social service exchange, Community welfare councils, councils of social agencies </p> 
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style=""> </span></p> 
              <p class="MsoNormal">2. The rise of Federation <span style=""> </span><span style=""> </span>1917 to 1935</p> 
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style=""> </span></p> 
              <p class="MsoNormal">It is period where we can see the growth and development of chests and councils. It started with the rise of war chests in 1917 and ended with the enactment of social security act, which set the stage for development of the public welfare programs in 1935. A large number of chests and councils came up after world war 1.The American Association for Community Organization was organized in 1918 as the national agency for chests and councils and it later became known as community chests and councils of<span style=""> </span>(CCC) America. The Cincinnati Public Health Federation, established in 1917 was the first independent health council in American City. It is in this period that the American Association of social workers organized in 1921, the first general professional organisations, set up its training for the social workers and others who specialized in community organization.</p> 
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style=""> </span></p> 
              <p class="MsoNormal">A community chest is a voluntary welfare agency, co-operative organization of citizens and welfare agencies, which is the powerful local force for community welfare origination that handles large funds. It has two functions. It raises funds through a community -wide appeal and distributes them according to a systematic budget procedure. Secondly it promotes co-operative planning. co-ordination and<span style=""> </span>administration of<span style=""> </span>the communities<span style=""> </span>social welfare.</p> 
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style=""> </span><span style=""> </span><span style=""> </span></p> 
              <p class="MsoNormal">3. Period of Expansion and professional Development 1935 to present time.</p> 
              <p class="MsoNormal">It is in this period the we see the greater use of the community organization process in the filed of public welfare. A marked significance of this era is the establishment of Federal Security Agency where we see the maximized involvement of the Govt. in welfare programs. In 1946 the agency was strengthened and re-organized following which in 1953 Department of Health, education and Welfare was established. </p> 
              <p class="MsoNormal">Another important factor of the period is about the professional development that took place. Some of the important professional developments are:</p> 
              <p class="MsoNormal">The National Conference of Social work in 1938-39 undertook a study on community organization, which later publicized the nature of "Generic Community welfare organization". Based on this another study took place in 1940, but due to America involvement in World War II an active program could not take off.</p> 
              <p class="MsoNormal">In 1946, at the National conference of social work in Buffalo, the Association of the study of community organization (ASCO) was organized. The main objective was to improve the professional practice of organization for social welfare. In 1955, ASCO merged with six other professional organisations to form the National Association of social workers. Community organization has been recognized as integral and important aspect of social work education in the American Association of Schools of social work education. At present thee is an active committee of Council on social work education involved in the production of teaching materials in community organization.<span style=""> </span></p> 
              <p class="MsoNormal">The first contemporary textbook on community organization titled " Community Organization for social welfare " published in 1945 has been written by Wayne McMilen's .</p> 
              <p class="MsoNormal">Another development in the history of community development is seen in the wake of World War II. Wartime needs were very special and crucial. During this time many councils and community war services came to the forefront. Among them (USO) united service organization is of prime importance as it was the union of many forces that served the needs of the military personnel and defense communities. The other striking characteristics of the period is the immense increase in the volunteer service i.e. defense council, American Red Cross and USO which co-ordinated and recruited the volunteers. </p> 
              <p class="MsoNormal">Another development that took place at the wartime is the growth of closer relationship between labor and social work, which is considered as great significance to community origination.</p> 
              <p class="MsoNormal">The other developments that took place after the World War II are as follows that are very specific to community organization area as follows.</p> 
              <p class="MsoNormal">The rehabilitation of the physically and mentally challenged </p> 
              <p class="MsoNormal">Mental health planning, problems of the aging </p> 
              <p class="MsoNormal">Prevention and treatment of juvenile delinquency.</p> 
              <p class="MsoNormal">In order to address theses issues separate bodies were set up and we see the entry of international agencies in the field of community origination. The present situation in community organization is the emergence of the new community development programs, which aims at providing, services to the less developed areas in the international social welfare. Therefore the present agenda is on working with the whole community and a greater emphasis on self -help.</p> 
              <p class="MsoNormal">COMUNITYORGANISATION IN U.K:</p> 
              <p class="MsoNormal">Baldock (1974) has summed up the historical development in U.K.<span style=""> </span>by diving it in to four phases.</p> 
              <p class="MsoNormal">The first Phase: - 1880-1920: During this period the community work was mainly seen as a method of social work. It was considered as a process of helping the individuals to enhance their social adjustments. It acted as major player to co-ordinate the work of voluntary agencies.<span style=""> </span></p> 
              <p class="MsoNormal">The second phase: - 1920-1950: This period saw the emergence of new ways of dealing with social issues and problems. The community organization was closely associated with central and state Govt.'s program for urban development. The important development in this period was its association with community association movement.</p> 
              <p class="MsoNormal">The third phase 1950 onwards: - it emerged as a reaction to the neighborhood idea, which provided an ideological phase for the second phase. It was period we see the professional development of social work. Most of the educators and planners tried to analyze the shortcomings in the existing system. It was also a period where the social workers sought for a professional identity. </p> 
              <p class="MsoNormal">The forth phase: It is a period that has marked the involvement of the community action. It questioned the very relationship of the community work and social work. It was thus seen as period of radical social movement and we could see the conflicts of community with authority. The association of social workers and the community were de-professionalised during this period. Thus it was during this period the conflictual strategies that were introduced in the community work, although even now there is no consensus on this issue (Baldock 1974).<span style=""> </span></p> 
              <p class="MsoNormal">HISTORY OF COMMUNITY ORGANIZATION IN INDIA</p> 
              <p class="MsoNormal">A historical account of the community organization is not available in India, as there has been only a rare documentation on social work literature in general and community organization in particular.</p> 
              <p class="MsoNormal">Community organization has its roots in the Charity organizations in the United States. They realized the need of the people and tied to organize the people to coordinate their work. The main activities were social welfare, raising funds, seeking enactment for the social legislation and co-ordination of welfare activities. The spirit behind all these activities was charity. In India, the very concept of charity is deep rooted in the religious philosophy. Even before the commencement of the social work education in India in 1937, the community work was in place. But in the first phase from 1937 t0 1952 the community work was in a dormant stage. During this period the social work was in its infancy and not many were employed in the community settings because. There were hardly any jobs that provided an opening for community organization. Professionals preferred to work in casework settings. </p> 
              <p class="MsoNormal">It was in 1952 the community development project was launched in India and with this we find the emergence of a new era of community work. The basic objective of community development in India was to awaken the rural people of their needs, instilling in them a sense of ambition for better life and making them aware of their right and power to find a solution for their problems. According to Mukerji (1961) Community development is a movement designed to promote better living for the whole community with the active participation and if possible with the initiative of community" According to him community development can be divided in to two process. 1.Extension education 2.Community organization. Extension education was expected to improve the quality of human beings by improving his/her knowledge and skills. By community organization Mukerji had in mind the setting up of three institutions in the village.</p> 
              <p class="MsoNormal">Village Panchayat</p> 
              <p class="MsoNormal">The village co-operative</p> 
              <p class="MsoNormal">The village school</p> 
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style=""> </span></p> 
              <p class="MsoNormal">During this period the thrust of the community work remained rural where as social work remained urban in character.</p> 
              <p class="MsoNormal">From 1970 onwards we could see a new trend in the community work practice. The social workers expanded their scope and operational area from their traditional approach of casework. to other developments fields. For example people working with school children started working with the community. The Ngo's and voluntary organization adopted a community approach. This shift has in-fact led to the use of process of community work. By and large the community work has remained welfare -oriented.</p> 
              <p class="MsoNormal">The current phase of community work in India is experiencing a growing dissatisfaction with its own practice or rather the out come of its practice. So efforts are on to create alternate ways of working with communities. In-spite of these, the professionals is involved in a variety of projects in both rural and urban areas to promote better living for the community. </p> 
              <p class="MsoNormal">Another trend in the community work is the involvement of the Business houses in promoting welfare in their neighborhood. This is commonly known as CSR. (Corporate social responsibilities) The business houses i.e. Tats, Escorts, and some of the multinational companies too have joined in this venture. This trend has attracted many professionals in this field </p> 
              <p class="MsoNormal">The main objective of community development is to develop village communities by methods, which will stimulate, encourage and aid villagers themselves to do much of the work necessary to accomplish the desired goals. The changes conceived and promoted should have the involvement of the people and should be acceptable to them and put in to practice by them.</p> 
              <p class="MsoNormal">THE DIFFERENCE:</p> 
              <p class="MsoNormal">There is a common philosophical base between community organization and community development. Both aims to enable people to live happily and fully developed life. Both have basic faith in the common man and his right to self-determination in the framework of the society. Both give emphasis to self-help and help the people to help themselves to solve their own problems. However, community organization and community development should not be considered as synonymous.</p> 
              <p class="MsoNormal">CD is concerned with the promotion of all aspects of life including social, economical and cultural; both in rural and urban areas. While CO is concerned with adjustment of social welfare needs and resources in cities, states, Nations as well as in villages?</p> 
              <p class="MsoNormal">CO is practiced in the USA on a voluntary basis. While CD in almost all the developing countries is a government-sponsored program.</p> 
              <p class="MsoNormal">CO is a product of urbanization and industrialization. Here the main concern is problems of the population mobility, problems of the family, problems of the aged, problems of the juvenile delinquency, of unemployment and provision of social security. But CD is concerned with how to induce people to meet their basic human needs.</p> 
              <p class="MsoNormal">CO tends to be more process oriented while CD as practiced in India tends to be target oriented. </p> 
              <p class="MsoNormal">2.5 GANDHIAN APPROACH TO COMMUNITY ORGANIZATION:</p> 
              <p class="MsoNormal">Gandhi has not given a literary definition of the term community. For him the village is the basic community with geographical limitation where a number of families come together and co-operate to build a common life. According to Gandhi the basic element of a community is mutual co-operation and common sharing.</p> 
              <p class="MsoNormal">The emphasis of Gandhian concept of community organization is the reconstruction of the community rather than on organizing of an unorganized or disorganized community or on the development of entirely a new community. Therefore the Gandhian objective of community organization is to reconstruct the village communities spread all over the country. This construction is based on the 19 item constructive program designed to meet the social welfare needs of the community.<span style=""> </span>It is through the construction of the village community Gandhi aims to realize he goal of reconstructing the "sarvodaya Social order". Gandhi has not given any specific or fixed pattern for the reconstruction program but left it to the capacity of those community organizers and to suit to the different conditions and social situations.</p> 
              <p class="MsoNormal">The role of the worker in this approach is very distinct. Here, the worker not only deals with those groups of people or communities who seek his guidance but he would also would approach those communities, which do not ask for help as his prime work being the reconstruction of the society. In this approach the worker takes initiatives and gradually stimulates the community .It demands the regularity and sincerity of the worker in the reconstruction program.</p>

              <p class="MsoNormal">2.6 MODELS OF COMMUNITY ORGANIZATION</p> 
              <p class="MsoNormal">WHAT IS A MODEL?</p> 
              <p class="MsoNormal">Before we proceed to understand the different methods and models of community organization it is wise to understand the terminology. What is a model?</p> 
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style=""> </span></p> 
              <p class="MsoNormal">Model:</p> 
              <p class="MsoNormal">It is a medium through which a person looks at the complex realities. Model is a simplistic version of a complex situation. Models serve as a reference for the work and give us a clear understanding of what would happen. They describe strategies for accomplishing a vision, the appropriate steps to be taken to get there. Some models grow out of the specific ideologies of change and some in response to concrete situations.</p> 
              <p class="MsoNormal">2.7.MODEL OF COMMUNITY ORGANISATION BY ROTHMAN:</p> 
              <p class="MsoNormal">Since 100 years people in various situations, countries have been trying to address the issues of social welfare .The study of the history helps us to know the drastic changes that took place. A major shift from the charity approach to the professional delivery of services. </p> 
              <p class="MsoNormal">Jack Rothman has introduced three basic models of community organization. They are:</p> 
              <p class="MsoNormal">Locality development</p> 
              <p class="MsoNormal">Social planning</p> 
              <p class="MsoNormal">Social Action</p> 
              <p class="MsoNormal">1.MODEL A- LOCALITY DEVELOPMENT:</p> 
              <p class="MsoNormal">Locality development model is a method of working with community groups .It was earlier used by the settlement houses. Here the important focus is about the process of community building. Leadership development and the education of the participants are the essential elements in the process.</p> 
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style=""> </span></p> 
              <p class="MsoNormal">According to Murray Ross the "process of self help and communal action is valuable in its own right". The model of locality development is based on this particular thought process. It originated from the traditional community organization practice. The main focus of this model is whole community or a part of it. The basic belief is that communities have some common needs and interests and once the people realize this need and work together democratically they can take appropriate steps to improve the quality of life.</p> 
              <p class="MsoNormal">Here the role of the community organizer is to enhance the involvement of the people in the community and help the community to plan and help them find a solution to the problem. It is similar to work of community development, which is done in the underdevelopment world.<span style=""> </span></p> 
              <p class="MsoNormal">It refers to the community organization practice when a worker or an agency attempts to develop various schemes and programs to meet the needs of the target population in a defined area. It also includes coordination of various agencies providing a variety of services in the area.</p> 
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style=""> </span></p> 
              <p class="MsoNormal">2.MODEL B- SOCIAL PLANNING:</p> 
              <p class="MsoNormal">It refers to the type of community work where a worker or agency undertakes an exercise of evaluating welfare needs and existing services in the area and suggests a possible blue print for a more efficient delivery of services, it is termed as social planning. It is concerned with social problems For example. Housing, education, health, childcare and so on. Its aim is to affect a large population. The community planner works in greater capacity with the government and is often identified with power structure of the community but interested in the needs and attitudes of the community.</p> 
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style=""> </span></p> 
              <p class="MsoNormal">3.MODEL C- SOCIAL ACTION:</p> 
              <p class="MsoNormal">According to Friedlander,W.A. ( 1963) " Social Action is<span style=""> </span>an individual, group or community effort within the framework of the social work philosophy and practice that aims to achieve social progress, to modify social policies and to improve social<span style=""> </span>legislation<span style=""> </span>and health and welfare services". Another model of community organization suggested by Rothman<span style=""> </span>is that of social action. According to him social action is a strategy used by groups or sub communities or even national organisations that feel that they have inadequate power and resources to meet their needs. So they confront with the power structure using conflict as a method to solve their issues related to inequalities and deprivation.</p> 
              <p class="MsoNormal">In this type of community organisations the community organizer uses all means to pressure the power structure to give in to demands. The role of organizers may differ depending the issues they get involved in. The role may be of advocate, activist, agitator, broker or negotiator. It is a process. This organizing process goes through different stage .So the role of the organizer will also change as per the roles of the organisor at each stage. </p> 
              <p class="MsoNormal">This model was commonly used during the 1960's. This has been used as a means to redress the social problems of the nation, redistribute the resources and power to the poor and powerless.<span style=""> </span>Social action as model has an important role in community organization.</p>

              <p class="MsoNormal">The History has witnessed diversity of efforts in the community organization and the emergence of new initiatives in the field. Most often these of community organizing efforts are centered on identity communities and issue-specific communities. History gives us a list of different kind of community organizing methods. One such community organizing which the twentieth century has witnessed is the growth of neighborhood organizing. </p> 
              <p class="MsoNormal">Neighborhood organizing:</p> 
              <p class="MsoNormal">Neighborhood organizing is one form of community organizing. This nothing but an effort by the community to solve the day to day problems and help those in need.</p> 
              <p class="MsoNormal">There are three type approaches to neighborhood organizing.</p> 
              <p class="MsoNormal">The social work Approach</p> 
              <p class="MsoNormal">Political Activists Approach</p> 
              <p class="MsoNormal">Neighborhood maintenance/Community development Approach</p> 
              <p class="MsoNormal">1.The social work Approach:</p> 
              <p class="MsoNormal">In this approach, the society is viewed as a social organism and therefore the efforts are oriented towards building a sense of community. The community organizer whose role is of an "enabler or an advocate " helps the community identify a problem in the neighborhood and strives to achieve the needed social resources by gathering the existing the social services and by lobbying with some in power to meet the needs of the neighborhood. This method is more consensual and the neighborhood is seen as a collective client. One example of this approach is the social settlement movement USA and war on poverty program of the Johnson administration in the 1960s.</p> 
              <p class="MsoNormal">2.The political Activists Approach:</p> 
              <p class="MsoNormal">Saul Alinsky, the Godfather of community organizing is the founder of this approach .He emerged as a community organizer in the 1930s.The basic philosophy of this approach is based on his thinking that " more representative the organization the stronger the organization." </p> 
              <p class="MsoNormal">In this approach the community is seen as a political entity and not as a social organism. Here, the neighborhood is viewed as a potential power base capable of getting power. The role of the community organizer is to help the community understand the problem in terms of power and necessary steps are taken to mobilize the community. The problem of the neighborhood is always identified as absence of power and in the interest of gaining power for the neighborhood the organizers are faced with conflicts with groups, interests and elities. Since most of the community organizers come from out side the community, it has faced the problems of equality of power relations and leadership in the community.<span style=""> </span></p> 
              <p class="MsoNormal">Unlike the social work approach to community organization this approach has the potential to create stable, democratic and effective organisations of neighborhood residents by seeing its role as " meeting power with power"</p> 
              <p class="MsoNormal">Neighborhood maintenance/Community development Approach:</p> 
              <p class="MsoNormal">This approach has emerged out of both the previous approaches namely within the same neighborhood movements. It is seen in the form of civic associations. This association uses peer group pressure to provide services in the community. They use this strategy to pressurize the officials to deliver services to the community but sometimes this approach takes the form of political activists approach as they realize that their goals can be only achieved only through confrontations.</p> 
              <p class="MsoNormal">In this approach we see the characteristics of de-emphasis on dissent and confrontation and these organisations view themselves as more proactive and development minded.</p> 
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style=""> </span></p> 
              <p class="MsoNormal">2.9.MODELS OF ROTHMAN:</p> 
              <p class="MsoNormal">It is important to have a theoretical frame work to work in the community. This theoretical framework facilitates the worker to adopt strategies and helps him choose the type of focus he/she wants to maintain in the professional practice. Rothman has given three models of practice, which are as follows:</p> 
              <p class="MsoNormal">Neighborhood development model</p> 
              <p class="MsoNormal">System Change model</p> 
              <p class="MsoNormal">Structural change model</p> 
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style=""> </span></p> 
              <p class="MsoNormal">1.Neighbourhood development Model:</p> 
              <p class="MsoNormal">Neighborhood Model is the oldest model of community organization. This model has been practiced in India and in some of the underdeveloped countries. It has been used in the developmental activities. In general it is believed that people living in a neighborhood have the capacity to meet the problems they come across in their day to day life through their own efforts and resources. The main aspect here is that the community realizes its needs and takes appropriate steps to meet the needs of the community, which will bring greater satisfaction to all its members both individually and collectively. The role of the worker in this model is to induce a process that will sensitize the community and make the community realize its needs. Based on the value of self-sustenance the worker energizes the community and makes the community self-reliant, and not merely depending on the help form out side. So rather than providing services in the community, the communities are energized to meet its own needs. This model encourages the people to think for themselves rather than doing things for them.</p> 
              <p class="MsoNormal">Some of the steps in this model are:</p> 
              <p class="MsoNormal">Identifying the geographical area for your intervention</p> 
              <p class="MsoNormal">Making your way to the community</p> 
              <p class="MsoNormal">Understand the community and identify the felt needs</p> 
              <p class="MsoNormal">Making an appropriate program</p> 
              <p class="MsoNormal">Planning for resource mobilization</p> 
              <p class="MsoNormal">Developing a strong net-work in the community</p> 
              <p class="MsoNormal">Planning for withdrawal from the community</p> 
              <p class="MsoNormal">2. SYSTEM CHANGE MODEL:</p> 
              <p class="MsoNormal">As the name suggests, the system change model aims at developing strategies to either restructure or modify the system. Thus it is termed as "System Change approach to community work. Although we find glimpses of this model gaining more acceptance, this has not become very popular. We know of various mechanisms that cater to the needs of the society. Such as education, health services housing, women empowerment, and employment. All these services are rooted through various systems and all these systems do have sub-systems. The fundamental aspect in this model is that the due to various reasons the systems become dysfunctional. For example the system of education as we have it today, reveals that the cities have better educational faculties as compared to the rural areas. This system (education policy) of education has generated disparities in the society. I.e. access to education, lack of basic facilities, trained staff, etc. The system instead of becoming a tool of empowering mechanism brings disparities between people of different socio-economic condition.<span style=""> </span>So the system has failed to achieve its objectives. Thus the worker on observing this disfunction in the community finds it important to develop strategies to restructure or modify the system.</p> 
              <p class="MsoNormal">Some of the tasks in this model are:</p> 
              <p class="MsoNormal">Understanding the deficiencies in the system.</p> 
              <p class="MsoNormal">Communicating the findings with the community</p> 
              <p class="MsoNormal">Making strategies to influence the decision making bodies. </p> 
              <p class="MsoNormal">Mobilizing peoples participation and seeking out-side support to translate the plan in to concrete action.</p> 
              <p class="MsoNormal">Making alliances and partnerships with other NGOS and comminutes to demand a change.</p> 
              <p class="MsoNormal">3.STRUCTURAL CHANGE MODEL:</p> 
              <p class="MsoNormal">One of the most difficult and rarely practiced models of community work is structural change model. The society consists of small communities and it is nothing but "a web of relationships". These relationships of the people are formally structured by the respective countries' state policies, law and constitutions and informally by its customs, traditions etc. that determines the social rights of the individuals. The social structure in some of the societies is controlled by the state. </p> 
              <p class="MsoNormal">Understanding the macro- structure of social relationship and its impact on the micro realities, the worker tries to mobilize the public opinion to radically change the macro-structure.<span style=""> </span>Thus the structural change model aims to bring a new social order, an alternative form of society which will transform the existing conditions at the micro-level. This can happen only if an alternative form of political ideology is adopted. This form of community work may originate from a community itself but it has a wider coverage coverage i.e. the entire society or nation. Sometimes this takes the shape of social action, which is an another method of social work profession. Since the general situation in the developing countries is very peculiar, it is very difficult for the community worker to actually practice this model.</p> 
              <p class="MsoNormal">A social worker may initiate this model. But it is very difficult to predict the success. However, he s makes attempt to saw the seeds of social change by adopting a political ideology .It might take decades to actually perceive any transformation in the society nevertheless one can be proud of being the agent of social change.</p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.25in; text-align: justify; line-height: 150%;">In social work profession there are three basic methods of working with people (individuals, families, groups and communities). We have already studied the two methods namely, social casework and social group work. The third basic method is community organisation. As we are aware social casework is aimed at helping individuals on one-to-one basis and social group work seeks to facilitate the development of individuals through group activities. The aim of community organisation is ‘developing a capacity’ in the community ‘by making it more organised’ to handle its own needs or problems. Community organisation is well-established method in social work. It has value orientation and the practice is guided by a set of general principles. </p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.25in; text-align: justify; line-height: 150%;"><b>Meaning: 
                <o:p></o:p></b></p> 
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.25in; text-align: justify; line-height: 150%;">Before we get to know more about community organisation as the method of social work, let us first understand the meaning of the term we use. The term community organisation has several meanings. It is being often used synonymous to community work, community development and community mobilization. In general, community organisation means helping the community to solve its problems. In the context of social work profession in 
               <st1:country-region st="on">
                <st1:place st="on">
                 India
                </st1:place>
               </st1:country-region>, the term is used to denote a method of social work to intervene in the life of a community. </p> 
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.25in; text-align: justify; line-height: 150%;">In sociology we learn that society and social institutions are more than just a collection of individuals. They include how those individuals are linked to each other. They are sets of systems such as economy, political organisation, value, ideas, belief systems, technology, and patterns of expected behaviours (social interaction). It means that just collections of individuals living at a common place are not necessarily organized. To call them organized they needs to have a set of common ideas and expectations. This gives them a social structure and some social processes that make the organisation something (social). It goes beyond the very individuals that compose the community.</p> 
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.25in; text-align: justify; line-height: 150%;">Further it is important to note that just forming various groups in community having some structure or form (e.g. having a president, treasurer, secretary, etc.) does not make the community organized. It is not the multiplicity of institutions, interest groups or set of activities, which make the organized community, for it, may create more conflicts and disrupt the normal life. Thus the important determining factors of community organisation are interaction, integration and co-ordination of the existing institutions, interest groups and activities, and evolving new groups and institutions if necessary to meet the changing conditions and needs of the community.</p> 
              <h3 style="text-align: justify; line-height: 150%;"><span style=";font-family:&quot;;">Definition:
                <o:p></o:p></span></h3> 
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.25in; text-align: justify; line-height: 150%;">To study and to be able to engage in community organisation practice it is necessary to have a clear definition. There are several definitions available in literature, which are put forth at different times and context. The common element in most of them is matching resources to needs. We will discuss here two most widely accepted definitions of community organisation. </p> 
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.25in; text-align: justify; line-height: 150%;">Murray G. Ross (1967) defines community organisation as a “process by which a community identifies its needs or objectives, gives priority to them, develops the confidence and will to work at them, finds resources (internal and external) to deal with them, and in doing so, extends and develops co-cooperative and collaborative attitudes and practices in the community”. </p> 
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.25in; text-align: justify; line-height: 150%;">In this definition by “process” he meant a movement from identification of a problem or objective to solution of the problem or attainment of the objective in the community. There are other processes for dealing with community problems, but here he called the community organisation process that by which the capacity of the community to function as an integrated unit grows as it deals with one or more community problems. The task of the professional worker in community organisation is to help initiate, nourish, and develop this process. His task is also to make this process conscious, deliberative, and understood. </p> 
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.25in; text-align: justify; line-height: 150%;">“Community,” in the sense in which it is used here, refers to two major groupings of people. Firstly it may be all the people in a specific geographic area, i.e., a village, a town, a city, a neighborhood, or a district in a city. In the same manner it could refer also to all the people in a province or a state, a nation, or in the world. Secondly, it is used to include groups of people who share some common interest or function, such as welfare, agriculture, education, and religion. In this context community organisation may be involved in bringing these persons together to develop some awareness of, and feeling for their “community” and to work at common problems arising out of the interest or function they have in common. </p> 
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.25in; text-align: justify; line-height: 150%;">The second definition that we discuss here is by Kramer and Specht (1975), which is in more technical terms. They defined that “Community organisation refers to various methods of intervention whereby a professional change agent helps a community action system composed of individuals, groups or organisations to engage in planned collective action in order to deal with special problems within the democratic system of values.” </p> 
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.25in; text-align: justify; line-height: 150%;">According to their explanations it involves two major interrelated concerns: (a) the interaction process of working with an action system which includes identifying, recruiting and working with the members and developing organizational and interpersonal relationships among them which facilitates their efforts; and (b) the technical tasks involved in identifying problem areas, analyzing causes, formulating plans, developing strategies and mobilizing the resources necessary to effect action. </p> 
              <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent">The analysis of both these definitions reveals that they cover the “Need-Resources Adjustment” approach, “the Social Relationships” approach and a combination of the two ideas of meeting needs and development of co-operative attitudes. </p> 
              <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent">The distinguishing features of community organisation practice are derived largely from the three dimensions. (1) The nature of its setting and focus- the community and its problems, 2) from the nature of its goals – enhanced functional capacity of the community and its ability to influence the social welfare policy and 3) from the techniques it employs towards effecting the inter-personal and inter-group relationships of the members of the community. The statements defining community organisation method stress individually or in combination the above three factors and also refer to clientele and the total process to which the method is applied. </p>

              <p class="MsoBodyText3">Having discussed the meaning and definition of Community organisation lets now try to situate it in the context of community work and social work profession. In social work the term “community work” is often used with different meanings. In social work literature we find that the term “community work”, “community development”, “Community Organisation” and “Community empowerment” are at times interchangeably used for the work with communities. Some authors have used these terms for the same type of work whereas others use them to refer to different type of work with communities. </p> 
              <p class="MsoBodyText3">Community work has a long history as an aspect of social work. It has passed through various phases. All over the world it has been recognized as an integral part of social work practice. History shows that community work even preceded social work education. In

               </st1:country-region> is largely seen as a process of developing local initiatives, particularly in the areas of education, health and agriculture development. The focus of the work is, to encourage people to express their needs, and enable them to avail the existing resources. </p> 
              <p class="MsoBodyText3">There are several ways in which social work practitioners and others work in the community. In social work we find three main approaches namely, Community Development, Community Organisation and Community relations/services. While these approaches represent different situations or areas of community work there are fundamental similarities in what is being attempted. Their components are often interlinked and at times overlapping. </p> 
              <p class="MsoBodyText3">What is important for us here to understand is that the community work is one of the basic social work processes. It is being used to attain the same basic objectives, as casework and groupwork. As you may be aware that all the social work methods are concerned with removal of the blocks to growth of individual, group, or community, release of their potentialities, full use of inner resources, development of capacity to manage one’s own life and their ability to function as an integrated unit. In community organisation particularly, social work is concerned with the initiation of that process which enable a community to overcome those blocks (apathy, vested interests, discrimination) which prevent the community from working together; release of potentialities and use of indigenous resources and growth of those cooperative attitude and skills which make possible achievement of increasingly difficult ends. </p> 
              <p class="MsoBodyText3">Thus, Community organisation is more of a product of the maturation process than of the beginnings of the profession. The increasingly complex and interdependent nature of modern society makes community organisation almost a pre-requisite for reasonably smooth functioning. </p>

              <h3>­­­­­­­­­­­1.5. The Value orientation of Community Organisation</h3> 
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 150%;">From the discussion above we understand that community organisation is an integral part of social work practice. In order to practice community organisation some obvious questions arise that how should it be done? Are there any value orientations and general principles that may guide us in deciding what is sound or good or socially desirable community organisation? What is desirable or accepted in community organisation practice? How to improve the chances of success in achieving the objectives of community organisation? We deal with these and such other questions in this section. </p> 
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 150%;">Community organisation derives from a unique frame of reference, the nature of which is based on a particular value orientation. In social work, the focus of community organisation practice is influenced by a system of personal and professional values. These values affects workers style of intervention and the skills they use in working with community members. Values are beliefs that delineate preferences about how one ought or ought not to behave. Such formulations of values obviously have a large subjective element. Values differ between groups and between individuals within the same group. Moreover, there has been no explicit, comprehensive, or generally accepted formulation of basic ethical and social values by any representative group of community organisation practitioners.<span style=""> </span></p> 
              <p class="MsoBodyText3">The value orientation of community organisation as of all social work derives from acceptance of certain concepts and facts as a foundation for work with people. Among these are the essential dignity and ethical worth of the individual, the possession by each individual of potentialities and resources for managing his own life, the importance of freedom to express one’s individuality, the great capacity or growth within all social beings, the right of the individual to those basic physical necessities (food shelter and clothing) without which fulfillment of life is often blocked, the need for the individual to struggle and strive to improve his own life and environment, the right of the individual to help in time of need and crisis, the importance of a social organisation for which the individual feels responsible and which is responsive to individual feeling, the need of<span style=""> </span>a social climate which encourages individual growth and development, the right and responsibility of the individual to participate in the affairs of his community, the practicability of discussion, conference, and consultation as methods for the solution of individual and social problems, “self help” as the essential base of any programme of aid, etc. These and other similar value orientations constitute the basis of community organisation. </p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 150%;">Principles of community organisation, in the sense in which the term is used here are generalized guiding rules for the sound practice. Principles are expressions of value judgments. The principles of community organisation, which are being discussed here, are within the frame of and in harmony with the spirit and purpose of social work in a democratic society. We are concerned with the dignity and worth, the freedom, the security, the participation, and the wholesome and abundant life o every individual. This implies following the principles of democracy, involvement of the marginalized, transparency, honesty, sustainability, self-reliance, partnerships, cooperation, etc. </p> 
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 150%;">In the literature of community organisation we find various sets of principles.

               <li class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 150%;"><b>Community organisation is means and not an end:</b> As discussed earlier the community organisation is a process by which the capacity of the community to function as an integrated unit is being enhanced. In this sense it is a method or a means to enable people to live a happy and fully developed life. It refers to a method of intervention whereby a community consisting of individuals, groups or organisations are helped to engage in planned collective action in order to deal with their needs and problems. </li>
               <li class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 150%;"><b>Community Organisation is to promote community solidarity and the practice of democracy: </b>It should seek to overcome disruptive influences, which threaten the well being of the community and the vitality of democratic institutions.

               <li class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 150%;"><b>The clear identification of the Community:</b> Since the community is the client of the community organisation worker, it must be clearly identified. It is likely that there are several communities with which he/she deals at the same time. Further it is important that once the community is identified the entire community must be the concern of the practitioner. No programme can be isolated from the social welfare needs and resources of the community as a whole. The welfare of the whole community is always more important than the interest or the well being of any one agency/group in the community.</li>

               <li class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 150%;"><b>Fact-finding and needs assessment:<span style=""> </span></b>Community organisation programmes should have its roots in the community. Proper fact-finding and assessment of the community needs is the pre requisite for starting any programme in the community. It is generally desirable for local community services to be indigenous, grass-roots developments rather than to be imposed form without. Whenever possible, then, a community organisation should have its origin in a need felt by the community or by some substantial number of persons in the community and there should be vital community participation, and usually essential community control, in its development.</li>
              </ol> 
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.5in; text-align: justify; line-height: 150%;">While facilitating the process of community organisation the programmes should be initiated, developed, modified, and terminated on the basis of the needs of the community and on the basis of the availability of other comparable services. When the particular need for a service is met, the programme should be modified or terminated. </p> 
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 150%;">

               <li class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 150%;"><span style=""> </span><b>Identification, Mobilization and Utilization of the available resources:</b><span style=""> </span>The fullest possible use should be made of existing social welfare resources, before creating new resources or services. In the absence of resources/services the worker has to mobilize the resources from various sources such as community, government, non-government agencies, etc. While utilizing the indigenous resources it must be recognised that these resources may sometimes need extensive overhauling before they will meet certain needs. Apart from mobilizing physical resources, indigenous human resources should be put to optimum use. </li>
               <li class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 150%;"><b>Participatory Planning: </b><span style=""> </span>The community organisation worker must accept the need for participatory planning throughout the process of community organisation. It is important that the practitioner prepares a blue print in the beginning of what he/she intends to do with the community. This is done with the community taking into consideration the needs of the community, available resources, agency objectives, etc. Planning in community organisation is a continuous process as it follows the cycle of implementation and evaluation.<span style=""> </span>The planning should be on the basis of ascertained facts, rather than an expression of guesswork, “hunches,” or mere trial and error. </li>
              </ol> 
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.5in; text-align: justify; line-height: 150%;">In order to foster the greater participation it is necessary to analyse the impeding factors and take timely steps to remove them. Instead of forcing people to participate in all the issues they should be encouraged to participate at a level and issues in accordance with their capacities. It must be noted that the people will participate if they are convinced of the benefits of the programme. </p> 
              <ol style="margin-top: 0in;" start="7" type="1">
               <li class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 150%;"><b>Active and vital participation: </b><span style=""> </span>The concept of self-help is a core of community organisation. The community members’ participation throughout the process of community organisation should be encouraged from the standpoint both of democratic principle and of feasibility- that is, the direct involvement in the progrmme of those who have the primary stake in it’s results. “Self-help” by citizen or clientele groups should be encouraged and fostered.<span style=""> </span></li>
               <li class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 150%;"><b>Communities’ right of self determination should be respected:<span style=""> </span></b>The Role of the Community organisation worker is to provide professional skill, assistance, and creative leadership in enabling peoples’ groups and organizations to achieve social welfare objectives. The community members should make basic decisions regarding programme and policy. While the community organisation worker plays a variety of roles in different situations, he is basically concerned with enabling peoples’ expression and leadership to achieve community organisation goals, and not with control, domination, or manipulation. </li>
               <li class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 150%;"><b>Voluntary cooperation:</b> Community organisation must be based upon mutual understanding, voluntary acceptance, and mutual agreement. Community organisation, if it is to be in harmony with democratic principles, cannot be regimentation; it should not be imposed from outside, but must be derived from the inner freedom and will to unite of those who practice it. </li>
               <li class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 150%;"><b>The spirit of cooperation rather than competition, and the practice of coordination of effort</b>: Community organisation practice should be based on the spirit of cooperation rather than competition. The community organisation practice has proved that the most effective advances are made through cooperative effort. It is by the coordinated and sustained programs attacking major problems rather than through sporadic efforts by various groups. </li>
              </ol> 
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.5in; text-align: justify; line-height: 150%;">The emphasis on collaborative and cooperative attitudes and practices does not imply elimination of differences, of tension, or of conflict. In fact we have to recognize that these later forces gives life and vitality to a movement. It must be understood that such conflict can be disruptive and destructive, or it can be positive and creative. What is important for the community organisation worker is that he/she identifies such forces and appropriately modifies them to the end beneficial to community as whole. </p>

However everyone in the community cannot be involved in face-to-face contact with all others in the community; therefore it is important to identify and recognize the leaders (both the formal and informal) accepted by various groups and subgroups in the community. Inclusion of the respected and accepted leaders with whom the major subgroups identify provides a major step in integrating the community and makes possible initiation of a process of communication which, if it becomes effective, will nourish and sustain the process of community organisation.</li>
               <li class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 150%;"><b>Limited use of authority or compulsion: </b>Invoking the application of authority or compulsion may sometimes be necessary in community organisation; but it should be used as little as possible, for as short a time as possible, and only as a last resort. When compulsion must be applied, it should be followed as soon as possible by resumption of the cooperative process. </li>
               <li class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 150%;"><b>The dynamic and flexible nature of Programmes and Services: </b>This principle is basic to sound community organisation. Social welfare agencies and programmes must be responsive to the changing conditions, problems, and needs of community life. Community is a dynamic phenomenon, which constantly changes and thus the needs and problems also keeps changing. Therefore it is necessary that the programmes and services are flexible enough. </li>
               <li class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 150%;"><b>Continual Participatory evaluation: </b>As programmes are developed to meet community needs, some time must be set aside for evaluation of the process. Regular feedback from the community is important. Criteria must be set up for evaluation of the programmes, to see how effective the action has been and what has been accomplished. <b>

              <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent">There are several definitions available in literature, which are put forth at different times and context. The common element in most of them is matching resources to needs. We will discuss here two most widely accepted definitions of community organisation. </p> 
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.25in; text-align: justify; line-height: 150%;">Murray G. Ross defines community organisation as a “process by which a community identifies its needs or objectives, gives priority to them, develops the confidence and will to work at them, finds resources (internal and external) to deal with them, and in doing so, extends and develops co-cooperative and collaborative attitudes and practices in the community”. </p> 
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.25in; text-align: justify; line-height: 150%;">Another definition that we discuss here is by Kramer and Specht (1975), which is in more technical terms. They defined that “Community organisation refers to various methods of intervention whereby a professional change agent helps a community action system composed of individuals, groups or organisations to engage in planned collective action in order to deal with special problems within the democratic system of values.” </p>

              <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent">In social work the term “community work” is often used with different meanings. In social work literature we find that the term “community work”, “community development”, “Community Organisation” and “Community empowerment” are at times found interchangeably used for the work with communities. Some authors have used these terms for the same type of work whereas others use them to refer to different type of work with communities. </p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 150%;">In social work, the focus of community organisation practice is influenced by a system of personal and professional values. These values affects workers style of intervention and the skills they use in working with community members. </p> 
              <p class="MsoBodyText3">The value orientation of community organisation as of all social work derives from acceptance of certain concepts and facts as a foundation for work with people. Among these are the essential dignity and ethical worth of the individual, the possession by each individual of potentialities and resources for managing his own life, the importance of freedom to express one’s individuality, the great capacity or growth within all social beings, the right of the individual to those basic physical necessities (food shelter and clothing) without which fulfillment of life is often blocked, the need for the individual to struggle and strive to improve his own life and environment, the right of the individual to help in time of need and crisis, the importance of a social organisation for which the individual feels responsible and which is responsive to individual feeling, the need of<span style=""> </span>a social climate which encourages individual growth and development, the right and responsibility of the individual to participate in the affairs of his community, the practicability of discussion, conference, and consultation as methods for the solution of individual and social problems, “self help” as the essential base of any programme of aid, etc. These and other similar value orientations constitute the basis of community organisation. </p>

It deals with intervention in the communities to solve the community problems. As a method of social work community organization can solve the problems of many people in the community through their collective involvement. Community organization and community development are inter-related as two sides of the same coin. The community organization includes other methods of social work, that is, group work, and casework. The power structure plays a role in the community organization. The social workers need to know the community power structure to practice community organization method. Community organization method is used for empowering people for their development. The details are provided for social work student to understand and practice community organization effectively.</p>

[Arthur E. Fink] It is used for solving community problems. The term Macro is used because of its ability to involve a large number of people in solving the social problems. Community organization is a macro method because; community organization can be successfully implemented at local level of community, or at state level of community, or at regional level of the community or at very large international level of community. For example,<span style=""> </span>community organization is possible for pollution control at local, state, regional national and inter national levels. It is a macro method because; casework deals with only one person, group work deals with limited number of participants. But community organization deals with number of people and so it is called as macro method. For example, Poverty cannot be solved by using individual approach like casework as there are many people affected by poverty. Individual approach is not practical due to the magnitude of the problem. We have to use a method, which can help a large number of people. While comparing other methods of social work community organization as macro method is useful for solving social problems like poverty. </p>

Community organization solves the Community Problems and fulfills the needs of the community. Many of the community problems like social injustice, poverty, inadequate housing, poor nutrition, lack of health, lack of medical services, unemployment, pollution, exploitation, bonded labour system, illicit arrack, dowry, female infanticide, women and children trafficking, drug trafficking etc. can be solved by using community organization method. In problem solving generally we use three basic aspects.<span style=""> </span>They are study, diagnosis, and treatment. The problem has to be studied. For this we have to collect information regarding the problem. From the information collected we have to find out the causes. This is called as diagnosis. Based on the findings, or diagnosis a solution is evolved that is called as treatment. We consider this model as medical model because doctors study the patient find out the causes for illness and based on findings, treatment or medicine is provided. Similar model is used in community organization method. Problems are solved with involvement of people. The resources are mobilized to solve the problems. This method is applicable for Indian situations because in

               </st1:country-region> a large number of people are affected by poverty or other poverty related problems. They need solutions. For this community organization as a problem solving method can solve community problems. For example people in the dry area suffer due to lack of water for their cultivation. With the help of the community organizer and people’s participation watersheds can be made and ground water level is increased. Water stored during rainy season can help the people to continue cultivation. Here the whole village problem is related with water for irrigation and drinking purpose, which is solved by using community organization method.<span style=""> </span></p>

People’s emotional involvement is necessary according to community organization method. If discontentment is created properly then people will volunteer for participation. Community organization emphasizes the discontentment and people’s participation. [c] Self-help is the basis for community development. Self-help deals with the capacity of mobilizing internal resources. Self-help is the basis for self-sufficiency and sustainable development. In community organization self-help is emphasized. Community organization is relevant to community development because both emphasizes the self-help concepts. [f] Development of leadership is an important aspect in community development.

In other words, power is the ability to make things happen. Floyd hunter explained the nature of power and power structure. Power appears in numerous forms and in a variety of combinations. Power flows from many sources. The money, votes, laws, information, expertise, prestige, group support, contacts, charisma, communication channels, media, social role, access to rewards, position, titles, ideas, verbal skill, ability to gratify important needs, monopoly of essential resources, alliances, energy, conviction, courage, interpersonal skills, moral convictions, etc. are some of the sources of power. The accumulation of power in a specific area is called as a power center. Power is also distributed. It is not confined within the power center. It is present at every level of the society. The powerless people do have power. They have to discover their power. Power may be ascribed by formal delegation or by title. Power may be achieved by many ways. For example, through competence, ability, or by personality etc. power can be achieved. Generally groups of people are at the top of the community. They are called as power centers at the top of the power pyramid. They influence the community through formal and informal connections. They influence through sub-ordinate leaders who do not participate in community decision-making process. The rich people are mostly powerful.<span style=""> </span>In some communities multiplicity of power structure is noticed.<span style=""> </span>Power structure is also flexible in nature. The community Organizer has to study the following ‘ How do some people influence the action of others? Who wields the power?<span style=""> </span>How?<span style=""> </span>What are the issues?<span style=""> </span>What are the results?<span style=""> </span>These aspects are to be analyzed by the organizer for effective practice of community organization. This is called as community power structure analysis. It is called as power because some people are capable of action in spite of the resistance of others who are participating in the action.<span style=""> </span>Some people are<span style=""> </span>powerful because they knew each other personally and they interact frequently making them involve in joint efforts in community affairs. People with power, make major community decision where as others are active in implementing such decisions. An organizer who is able to study the power structure well can practice community organization effectively. For example, the village traditional leader is a powerful person. The leader can influence other people to act. Many times this leader is motivated to involve in achieving the goals of the community. The leader is capable of influencing people effectively. When there is opposition from a few men, it can be tackled by the leader because the leader has power. </p>

The decision-making is the source and out come of the power. Some times there is a possibility of many number of power centers. Each power center may be autonomous. The organizer needs knowledge, and ability to mobilize the power in the community for achieving the goals of the community.</p>

[1960]. The power center change is achieved by institutional changes. Saul Alinsky gave importance for grass-root approach. In grass-root approach lower level people should get deciding power. Power and authority are connected. Authority is the legitimatization of power. These details are used in community organization to achieve people’s participation and successful achievement of the goal.</p>

People who are influential can mobilize a major segment of the community. For example; in fund raising drive some people can move behind other people and institutions. There are two models of community power structure. The stratification model and the pluralist mode are the two models of power structures. Stratification model suggests that social class principally determines the distribution of community power. According to this model the power structure in community is composed of stable upper class elite whose interest and out look on community affairs are relatively homogeneous. According to pluralist model, it rejects the idea that a small homogeneous group dominates community decision-making. But there are numerous small special interest groups that cut across class lines, which are represented in the community decision-making. These are interest groups with overlapping memberships, widely differing power bases, have influences on decisions. Community decisions are the result of the interactions of these different interest groups. This theoretical orientation can help the community organizer in his action. The organizer has to identify the members of the power structure for community organization. Floyd Hunter an executive director of a community welfare council wrote classic volumes on community power structure. His method of locating community elites is known as the reputation approach.<span style=""> </span>The basic procedure is to ask a group of informants who are knowledgeable about the community to list the people they believe to be most influential in the community affairs.<span style=""> </span>There may be variations on this procedure with regard to how informants are selected, and how questions are put in.<span style=""> </span>By tallying those people most frequently named as influential leaders we can identify the core of the community power structure. Position approach is another method of locating the members of the power structure based on the assumption of stratification model. This approach assumes that people holding the highest office in the community are at the top of the power structure. By scanning the executive lists of the important social political and economic organizations in the community, one can quickly compile a list of members of the power structure. This approach requires fewer efforts than the reputation approach. Community power is directly related with Community Organization. Participation of people is related with power. In Community Organization community power holders are involved to induce people’s participation in order to achieve the organizations objectives. Some times if the existing power centers are not for Community Organizational objectives, then a new center of power is created to get people’s commitment and mass participation. The organizer needs to study power structure and Community Organization process is carried out successfully through leaders. For example, people are organized to implement family planning. For this the leader is motivated for people’s participation. In some villages the leader opposes family planning. In this situation the community organizer has to identify a new powerful leader to implement family planning. Other wise it is not possible to implement family planning in the village.</p>

These people can be helped to feel powerful to decide their own affairs using community organization. When they learn to solve their problems they feel powerful. We can develop confidence and capacity building so that they feel that they can solve their problems by themselves. In community organization, the people carry out decision-making. This provides them with a sense of empowerment. Empowerment deals with providing disadvantaged groups with a powerful instrument for articulating their demands and preferences by awareness, decision-making capacity and to achieve their goal with freedom.<span style=""> </span>Community Organization results in empowerment of the people. But there are some hindrances like fatalism, illiteracy, superstitions, and caste divisions etc. Some times the vested interested groups may be a hindrance or barriers for empowerment.<span style=""> </span>The Community dependence, long time effect of poverty, and wrong beliefs etc., act as barriers to empowerment. When people are organized, they get the power. There are leaders in the community, they are united, they can work together, and they can co ordinate with each other. This makes them feel powerful. Thus community organization results in empowerment of people. The empowerment helps the community to stand against exploitation, ability to solve<span style=""> </span>problems, and to achieve the desired goals. Many of the economic problems can be easily solved by community organization and empowerment of community. </p>

The ancient social relations, emotional bonds and sentimental ties are no more significant and visible. The community consciousness is rapidly lowering down. Dirty politics has housed into the peaceful life of the community people and they are divided into different political groups and sub-groups. The joint family system is fast disintegrating and strains on human mind are increasing. Communal disharmony, gender inequality, factionalism, protection of rights of marginalized groups, feelings of deprivations among different classes like cultivators, industrial workers, daily wage earners, alteration of property relations in favour of the less privileged and impact of macro policies at micro levels are the some current issues which require immediate intervention while working with communities, institutions and organizations. This unit gives you a broad understanding of issues, which are affecting the dynamics of the healthy life styles and functioning of the communities and organizations.

There is a need of a ‘system of equal existence’ of ‘Men’ and ‘Women’. Unfortunately, our present system is involved in developing its own set of rules, which is basically responsible for discrimination and injustice of women and girl child in our society.

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 150%;">Caste and class both are status groups. A status group is an association of individuals who enjoy a distinctive style of life and a certain consciousness of kind. However, castes are perceived as hereditary groups with a fixed ritual status while classes are defined in terms of the relations of production. The members of a class have a similar socio-economic status in relation to other classes in the society, while the members of a caste have either a high or a low ritual status in relation to other castes. </p> 
              <h2><span style="">Caste as a Unit and as a System
                <o:p></o:p></span></h2> 
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 150%;">Caste is considered viewed both as a unit and as a system. It is also understood as a structural phenomenon as well as a cultural phenomenon. As a unit, caste can be defined as a ‘closed rank status group’, that is a group in which the status of the members, their occupation, the field of mate selection and interaction with others is fixed. As a system, it refers to interrelated status and patterned interaction among castes in terms of collectivity of restrictions, namely, restriction on change of membership, occupation, marriage and communal relations. In viewing caste as a system, there is pre-supposition that no caste can exist in isolation and that each caste is closely involved with other castes in the network of economic, political, and ritual relationships. The ‘closed-rank group’ feature of caste also explains its structure. As a cultural phenomenon, caste may be viewed as a “ set of values. Beliefs and practices.” </p>

Prof. K. N. Sharma has termed them ‘resource groups’ with a view to lay stress on their collaborative function. Occasionally, the ‘alliance’ between the groups is restricted only for the duration of achievement of the purpose. Mostly families are engaged in such alliances. Nevertheless, in some cases even brothers of same families have joined various factions and have disassociated themselves from each other at the cost of their kinship relationships. 
                <o:p></o:p></span></p> 
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 150%;"><span style=""> </span>The faction (within the sub-caste) is an association of a few core families to face challenges from other families, or to secure help in court cases, and so on. Such factions / alliances can be seen in the evening when people come back from their fields or offices and cluster in small groups to spend together their leisure time. In this way the closeness with the group is strengthened daily by intimate and informal relations and its strength is activated time to time for status defense or exaggeration. A faction may continue for decades or for few years or few months or it may change unexpectedly as no hard and fast rules ties the members together. However, within the faction, caste / sub-caste are of notable significance in towns and cities.<span style=""> </span></p> 
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 150%;"><span style=""> </span>The strength of the factions depends on wealth, manpower and ability to mobilize resources and influence from outside the village. </p>

Rather, it has widely, very strongly and seriously hampered all the efforts to promote development of villages in the country. As they (factions) oppose one another, not because of any genuine reason or rhyme but simply for the sake of showing the opposition and demonstration of their strength. As a consequence, any effort made by any change agent- external or internal, to promote co-operative and collaborative attitudes and practices in the community, gets badly thwarted.<span style=""> </span></p>

Community organisation covers largest mumber of clients at a time to solve their socio economic or Psychosomatic problems. Social work methods are well adopted in practice in America and England and in some other developed countries but comparatinely they are still in their infancy in developing and underdeveloped countries. Efforts have been made to provide services through launching various community awareness and development programs in these countries but still much needs to be done.
