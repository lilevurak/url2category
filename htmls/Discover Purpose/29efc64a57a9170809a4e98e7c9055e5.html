        <p>"Life can be hard and takes work. Achieving your goals can be hard and takes work. You will get knock backs. There will be tears and moments of frustration. Stay focused. Be persistent. Respect yourself and others. Never be afraid to admit fear. Never be afraid to ask for help. Never be afraid to admit your mistakes. Never fear the unknown. Anything can happen. It's a place that you can create. Never stop dreaming. Never stop believing. Never fear stepping out of your comfort zone, for this is where progress is made and lessons are learned.

        <p>"My life: Interesting, boring, creative, irrelevant and sometimes foolish. I am courageous, weak, strong, selfish and cooperative. My success is determined by careful planning, wise strategy. Every day I challenge the unlimited with any skills I have. I must succeed even if failure is inevitable.<br><br> I strive every day to expect a victory in the face of seemingly insurmountable odds. I claim pain, fear, defeat and humiliation as my right. I know that fate and destiny are all words used by people who are too lazy to do the work. I'm trying to achieve perfection although that I know there is no perfection in this world.<br><br> I refuse to not stop on my own performance. My commitment is to live with the perfection that is in me. My strength never gives up despite falling to earth. I will get up and start again, reinforced only with courage and determination. I will always remember that all of these are my curse, my hope, my pain, my joy, my triumph, my tragedy, my dream, my nightmare, my excuse and my purpose to reach my GOAL!"<br> <font class="mvusAuthor">Written in 2014 by Daisy Arie --- Malaysia</font></p>

        <p>"When you take action, particularly bold action, the boundaries of what you believe to be possible (your belief system) expand.
