          <p><strong>TIP Sheet<br>STUDY TIPS FOR BIOLOGY CLASSES </strong></p> 
          <p>Studying for biology classes is very different from studying for history or English classes.&nbsp;Strategies that worked well in those classes may not work well here.&nbsp;The following are study strategies that are geared toward students in biology classes.&nbsp;You probably won't have time to try all of these strategies, but pick a few that you think may help and try those.&nbsp;The key is to find as many different ways to work with the information that you are given.</p> 
          <p><strong>Before Class</strong></p> 
          <ul> 
           <li>It's very important that you read the text before class; but HOW you read the book makes all the difference.<br> 
            <ul> 
             <li>If you don't have time to read the whole chapter, at least look at the pictures (and read the captions).&nbsp;Biology is a visual subject and many of the concepts are best explained as a picture.</li> 
             <li>Don't try to memorize the whole chapter.&nbsp;Many instructors will not use ALL the information in the text, and will add information that is not in the text.&nbsp;The instructor will let you know which parts of the chapter are most relevant.</li> 
            </ul> </li> 
           <li>Make a list of all the words in the chapter that you don't understand.&nbsp;It is very likely that these are terms that the teacher will explain in class.&nbsp;If you already have these words written down&nbsp;– you will have a head start on note taking in class.&nbsp;Also, you are more likely to understand the lecture if you have an idea about what terms will be important (even if you don't know what they mean)</li> 
           <li>If a picture is used multiple times in the same chapter - it's probably important. You may want to photocopy the picture and bring it with you to class.&nbsp;Or, maybe find a similar picture online and print it out.&nbsp;Labeling a picture may be easier than trying to draw it in your notes.&nbsp;However, this strategy may not be appropriate&nbsp;– it depends on the class and the instructor.</li> 
           <li>If the instructor has online notes, review sheets, or other information,&nbsp;read them prior to class.&nbsp;Also, make sure to bring them with you to class.</li> 
          </ul> 
          <p>&nbsp;</p> 
          <p><strong>During Class</strong></p> 
          <ul> 
           <li>Come prepared!&nbsp;Bring your book as well as any note sets / review sheets that the instructor provides.&nbsp;You can often save yourself time if you take notes in the book or on the note sets rather than in class.&nbsp;One of the most common difficulties in science classes is that it's difficult to keep up with the speed of lectures.&nbsp;If you have the pictures from the book (or photocopies) you will be able to take notes much more quickly. 
            <ul> 
             <li>If you do take notes in your book or somewhere else&nbsp;– make sure to include that in your notes.&nbsp;Write something like "see fig 3.5" in your notes so that you know when to look at the pictures in the book.</li> 
            </ul> </li> 
           <li>Don't try to write down everything the instructor says.&nbsp;This is one of the more difficult aspects of being a student&nbsp;– knowing what's important in a lecture.&nbsp;It takes practice.&nbsp;Some hints for taking notes: 
            <ul> 
             <li>If the instructor writes it on the board&nbsp;– put it in your notes.</li> 
             <li>If the instructor says "this is important" or something similar&nbsp;– put it in your notes.</li> 
             <li>If the instructor refers to something in the book&nbsp;– write down the page or figure number so you can go back to it later.</li> 
             <li>Develop a system for taking notes.&nbsp;There are official methods for taking notes&nbsp;– or you can develop your own.&nbsp;If there are sets of words that are used a lot in class&nbsp;– make up a symbol for them that you will remember.&nbsp;(You may want to make a list of these symbols in case you forget.)&nbsp; 
              <ul> 
               <li>You can try working on your note-taking system by watching a TV show or movie and taking notes.</li> 
              </ul> </li> 
             <li>If you miss something during lecture: 
              <ul> 
               <li>Ask the instructor to repeat the information.</li> 
               <li>Leave a space and move on&nbsp;– come back and fill in what you missed later.</li> 
               <li>Don't miss the next point because you were asking your neighbor about the last point.</li> 
              </ul> </li> 
            </ul> </li> 
           <li>If something is unclear in class&nbsp;– ASK! 
            <ul> 
             <li>Most instructors won't mind you asking for clarification in class.&nbsp;It's often embarrassing to be the one asking the questions&nbsp;– but your fellow students will be glad you did.&nbsp;(They probably have the same question, and were just too shy to ask.)</li> 
             <li>Asking questions does not make you seem like a dumb student&nbsp;– it makes you seem like an interested student.</li> 
            </ul> </li> 
           <li>If you have the time, you may want to record the lectures.&nbsp;This way, if you miss something, you can always go back to it.&nbsp;You can also listen to the whole lecture again.&nbsp;Some students listen to these on their way to work&nbsp;– it makes time spent in traffic more productive.&nbsp;Or, you can listen to them as you clean the house, or go jogging.&nbsp;The key to this strategy is repetition&nbsp;– it may not stick the first time, but it will stick eventually.</li> 
          </ul> 
          <p>&nbsp;</p> 
          <p><strong>In a Lab Class</strong></p> 
          <ul> 
           <li>Read the lab for that day and make sure you fully understand what you are doing in class.&nbsp;In most lab classes, you will be expected to be self-sufficient in completing the assignments, so you do need to understand what is expected of you that day.&nbsp;As an added bonus, if you are organized and have a plan&nbsp;– you may even finish early.&nbsp;On the other hand, if you spend your lab time figuring out what you are supposed to do, you may not finish the lab.</li> 
           <li>Divide and conquer. You may not have time to do all parts of the experiment on your own.&nbsp;Part of the skills that a laboratory class is meant to teach is how to work together.&nbsp;However, make sure you understand all parts of the experiment, even if you didn't actually conduct it yourself.</li> 
          </ul> 
          <p>&nbsp;</p> 
          <p><strong>After Class</strong></p> 
          <ul> 
           <li>Rewrite your notes. This is time-consuming but does two things.&nbsp;It gives you a chance to review what you covered in class and make sure you didn't miss anything.&nbsp;It also gives you a well-organized set of notes to study for the test. 
            <ul> 
             <li>This strategy works best if the notes are redone shortly after class.</li> 
            </ul> </li> 
           <li>Use the resources that are provided!&nbsp;The Biology department has worked hard to be able to provide a study room (LS 126) for its students.&nbsp;Please make use of it.&nbsp;There may be models, practice tests, or computer resources that are available to you in that room.&nbsp;There are also tutors that can help answer questions.</li> 
           <li>Find online resources that cover the same information.&nbsp;Try typing the topic and the word "tutorial" or "quiz" into a search engine.&nbsp;I recommend using google.com - it's a very comprehensive search engine.&nbsp;Google also has an image library that you can search for pictures of bacteria, muscles, flowers, or whatever you are looking for.</li> 
           <li>If you have any questions, ask your instructor during office hours.&nbsp;Instructors NEVER mind that you are asking them questions (that are related to the class).</li> 
          </ul> 
          <p>&nbsp;</p> 
          <p><strong>Studying for the test</strong></p> 
          <ul> 
           <li>Write your own test.&nbsp;If you had 20 (or 50, or 100) questions that you could ask about this information&nbsp;– what would you ask?&nbsp;What topics are the most important?&nbsp;How would you ask questions about each of these topics?&nbsp;Knowing what will be on a test is a difficult skill&nbsp;– but, with practice, you should be able to figure it out.</li> 
           <li>Find a study group.&nbsp;This technique doesn't work for everyone, but it can be very effective.&nbsp;Talk through the subject matter and make sure everyone understands it, or quiz each other.&nbsp;This is a great resource to make sure that you aren't misunderstanding the concepts.</li> 
          </ul> 
          <p>&nbsp;</p> 
          <p><strong>Strategies for memory-based tests<br></strong>The strategies below are particularly useful for classes or topics that have a lot of vocabulary or names.</p> 
          <ul> 
           <li>Flashcards, an old favorite.&nbsp;The key to flashcards is to write VERY LITTLE on the card.&nbsp;Some students even cut the cards in half so they don't write too much on them.&nbsp; 
            <ul> 
             <li>Some tips for how to make good flashcards: 
              <ul> 
               <li>One side of the card should have one vocabulary word on it and the other side should have a definition or picture</li> 
               <li>Alternatively, you could write one question on the front side, and the answer on the back.</li> 
              </ul> </li> 
             <li>Some tips for using flashcards: 
              <ul> 
               <li>Make sure to study the flashcards in both directions (looking at the word and saying the definition, and looking at the definition and saying the word).</li> 
               <li>Keep them with you.&nbsp;Study them as you wait in line or as the microwave is going.&nbsp;The key here is&nbsp;– a little studying more often is better than a lot of studying for a short time.</li> 
               <li>Make piles with your flashcards.&nbsp;A pile for the information you know and a pile for the information you forgot.&nbsp;Then take the second pile and go through it again&nbsp;– and again, put the cards into two piles.&nbsp;This way you spend more time studying the cards that you are having a difficult time with.</li> 
              </ul> </li> 
            </ul> </li> 
           <li>Photocopy pictures from the book (and remove the labels).&nbsp;Make about five copies of each picture.&nbsp;Hang these pictures all over your house (your family will have to deal with it!). As you walk by each picture, label one thing on the picture.&nbsp;Next time you walk by it, label something else.&nbsp;Soon you will have labeled most of the items on the picture.&nbsp;When you have one or two left&nbsp;– if you know them, label them&nbsp;– if you don't know them, study them.</li> 
           <li>Get a coloring book.&nbsp;There are some very good coloring books on the market.&nbsp;They have coloring books for most of the topics you will study.&nbsp;These are a great resource, and a good way to learn certain material.&nbsp;Again, the key is a little at a time.&nbsp;Color one page over lunch, one as you are watching TV after dinner, etc.&nbsp; 
            <ul> 
             <li>If you can't afford a coloring book (they can be a bit pricey), photocopy or trace the pictures from the textbook - then color and label them.&nbsp;(Make a few copies of these pictures and remove the labels.)</li> 
            </ul> </li> 
           <li>Look for online quizzes.</li> 
           <li>Make sure to use the open lab time, if it's provided.&nbsp;Pictures are nice, but they are not the same as the real thing.&nbsp;Use these study strategies as you are holding and looking at the 3-dimensional models/specimens: 
            <ul> 
             <li>Look at the list of terms and identify all of them on the object.</li> 
             <li>Without looking at a list, point to and name all the parts of the object that you need to know.&nbsp;Then, check the list.</li> 
             <li>Without looking at a list, point to and write down the names of all the parts of the object that you need to know.&nbsp;Then check the list.&nbsp;Remember, on the test you will have to write (and spell the word), not say it out loud.</li> 
             <li>Have someone point to a part and you write it on a sheet of paper.&nbsp;This is the best way to study because this is how most lab practicals are set up.&nbsp;If you can't find another student to quiz you, ask the tutors or your instructor.</li> 
            </ul> </li> 
          </ul> 
          <p>&nbsp;</p> 
          <p><strong>Study strategies for concept-based tests</strong><br>These strategies work best for classes and topics that discuss processes.</p> 
          <ul> 
           <li>The following is a method to help you learn a difficult process (for example, if you have to learn all the steps of aerobic respiration).&nbsp;When you are comfortable with one of these steps, move on to the next level of difficulty: 
            <ul> 
             <li>Draw, trace, or photocopy a picture of the process from your book (remove the label).&nbsp;Write the vocabulary words that relate to the process on another sheet of paper.&nbsp;Be able to put the right term in the right place on the picture.</li> 
             <li>Now try to label the picture without the terms in front of you.</li> 
             <li>Now look at the list of vocabulary words.&nbsp;Put the words in order and draw the picture.&nbsp;Color-code the different steps of the process.</li> 
             <li>Now take a blank sheet of paper and draw the picture from scratch, without any words in front of you.&nbsp;Label the picture you have drawn.</li> 
             <li>Now take a blank sheet of paper and draw the process backwards.&nbsp;(Hey, why not!)</li> 
            </ul> </li> 
           <li>Do the above process, but instead of drawing a picture, write a paragraph explaining the process. 
            <ul> 
             <li>You can also take all the parts of the process and put them on note cards.&nbsp;Now, use the note cards to explain the process.</li> 
             <li>Or, you can buy play-doh and build a model of the process.&nbsp;(It doesn't really matter how you do this&nbsp;– but you need to take the process and break it down into smaller parts that you can understand and put together.)</li> 
            </ul> </li> 
           <li>Explain what you learned in class to your roommate or family member.&nbsp;Ask them if they understand what you have explained.&nbsp;Pretend you are the instructor&nbsp;– how would you present the information?&nbsp;(You may lose a few friends, but you will get a better grade&nbsp;– what are your priorities?)</li> 
           <li>Also try: 
            <ul> 
             <li>Explaining the process out-loud to yourself.&nbsp;Hearing it may help you remember.</li> 
             <li>Explain the process to a classmate and ask them for feedback.</li> 
             <li>Explain the process to your instructor.&nbsp;This way you can be sure that you didn't miss anything.</li> 
            </ul> </li> 
          </ul> 
          <p>There are many other good study strategies.&nbsp;Talk to your classmates or teacher if you want more ideas.</p>
